# Variables and Types
# Python is completely object oriented, and not "statically typed". You do not need to declare variables before using them, or declare their type. Every variable in Python is an object.

# This tutorial will go over a few basic types of variables.

# Numbers
# Python supports two types of numbers - integers(whole numbers) and floating point numbers(decimals). (It also supports complex numbers, which will not be explained in this tutorial).

# To define an integer, use the following syntax:
myint = 7
print(myint)

# To define a floating point number, you may use one of the following notations:

myfloat = 7.0
print(myfloat)
myfloat = float(7)
print(myfloat)
